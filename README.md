# Little-ToDo-List
A command line based ToDo list

## Installation
It is currently not public, but when it is, I think the following shell script will work:
`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ACertainPersons/Little-ToDo-List/main/install.sh)"`

Or you can run the following in your terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/ACertainPersons/Little-ToDo-List.git && cd little-todo-list && touch data.txt archive.txt && echo "Nothing to do ;) Use ./todo.sh -a to write in a new item" >> data.txt`
